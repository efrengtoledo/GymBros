10/05 Deliverables:
  - Designed basic frontend code for what the app should look like. Specifically the Join and Sign in Pages
  - Did lots of research on navigation hierarchies in SwiftUI 
  - At this point Im making decent progress, but I could tell that the UI might give me problems in the future, gonna have to rework it eventually
  - Issue came up with XCode not being able to push my code to github. Will resolve by next sprint.

10/19 Deliverables:
  - Installed Firebase SDK and can now use Firebase Auth in my project. 
  - I am able to get an account registered on my account, but I am still having trouble getting users signed back in and letting them sign out once they're         done using the app
  - Plan on reworking navigation hierarchy and cleaning up UI because its looking sloppy at the moment.

11/02 Deliverables:
  - Users can now create/sign in/sign out of app as they please with Firebase. 
  - Doing some research on what database to use for user schema. Leaning towards Firebase or Mongodb. Probably gonna end up being Firebase, but it costs money so I gotta get that figured out with professor.
  - Started to implement GPS functionality for matching capabilities. We don't want users matching with each other but living hundreds of miles away from each other

11/09 Deliverables:
  - Added some more hierarchy views for what will eventually be the functionality for saving and modifying workouts
  - Im realizing that the online functionality is much harder to implement than I previously expected, but I will still add a button so I can impliment that feature in the near future

11/16 Deliverables:
  - Our app functionality is starting to take shape. The goal I came with for this week was to have our CreateWorkout view update in real time instead of having to refresh the page for any changes to take place. We need a View Model for this
  - I created a view model with multiple dropdown options. For instance, we have the option to select the type of workout, the length, the rest time and the number of sets.
  - I also redesigned the UI to support dark mode on IOS

11/23 Deliverables:
  - Added app functionality. 
  - User can now create a workout and it will be saved in the FireStore 
  - Eventually, the goal is to have users match and communicate, then send these workouts to each other. I dont think I have enough time to implement this feature though
